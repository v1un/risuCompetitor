- Need to create font and spacing customization options

### 4. Export/Import Functionality
- Basic export/import started
- Need to complete standardized JSON format for all content types
- Need to implement batch export/import capabilities
- Need to add selective import with conflict resolution

## High Priority Items to Implement

### 1. Keyboard Shortcuts and Accessibility (CRITICAL)
- Previous implementation was deleted and needs to be recreated
- Need to implement keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- Need to add screen reader support with ARIA attributes
- Need to improve focus management and keyboard navigation
- Need to create high contrast mode for visually impaired users

### 2. Combat Management System (CRITICAL)
- Need to create turn-based combat flow management
- Need to implement attack resolution and damage calculation
- Need to add tactical positioning and movement tracking
- Need to create AI assistance for enemy tactics and balancing

### 3. Inventory Management System (HIGH)
- Need to create item database with categories and properties
- Need to implement character inventory management
- Need to add equipment slots and equipped item effects
- Need to create item generation and loot tables

### 4. Error Handling and Fallback Mechanisms (HIGH)
- Need to centralize error handling for all API calls
- Need to implement automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Need to add graceful degradation when API services are unavailable
- Need to create user-friendly error messages with recovery suggestions

### 5. Prompt Engineering Improvements (HIGH)
- Need to refine character generation prompts for more consistent outputs
- Need to improve world-building prompts to create more coherent settings
- Need to enhance narrator prompts to maintain consistent tone and style
- Need to add system prompts that better guide AI behavior

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Focus**: Recreate the KeyboardShortcutManager to restore keyboard shortcut functionality
2. **Short-term Priority**: Complete the Combat Management System as it's critical for gameplay
3. **Medium-term Priority**: Implement the Inventory Management System and improve error handling
4. **Ongoing Work**: Continue enhancing the Model Selection UI and rich text formatting

## Resource Allocation Recommendation

- **Frontend Development**: Focus on Combat Management System and Inventory Management
- **Backend/Services**: Focus on Error Handling and API integration improvements
- **AI/Prompt Engineering**: Focus on improving prompts and AI response quality
- **UX/Accessibility**: Focus on recreating KeyboardShortcutManager and implementing accessibility features

## Timeline Adjustment

Based on current progress, we recommend:
- Extending Phase 4 (Advanced RPG Features) completion to end of Q3 2024
- Starting Phase 5 (Collaboration and Sharing) in early Q4 2024
- Maintaining Phase 6 (Performance and Scalability) target for Q1 2025

## Conclusion

While we've made significant progress on several key features, the loss of the KeyboardShortcutManager implementation is a setback that needs immediate attention. Additionally, the Combat Management System has been identified as the highest priority feature to implement next, as it's critical for the core gameplay experience.

The team should focus on these high-priority items while continuing to enhance the existing implementations of the Model Selection UI, rich text formatting, and customizable UI themes.
