- **Interactive Support Tools**: Visual tools for tracking game state and progression
- **Local-First Architecture**: All data stored locally with no cloud dependencies
- **Customizable Themes**: Personalized visual experience
- **Series-Based Organization**: Content organized by series/setting

## Technical Stack

- **Application Framework**: Electron
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Local Database**: SQLite
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API and OpenRouter API

## Current Status
